## Original System

The original system allowed a Humanoid walker to walk along a beam without falling, using a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent for control
More information can be found here: https://uk.mathworks.com/help/physmod/sm/ug/humanoid_walker.html

## New System
The new system expands on this original idea, incorporating a variety of new features:

	Full actuation of the arms of the walker (4 DoF each)
	A customizable cuboid, which the walker can kick, shove and see to a limited extent
	Realistic, customizable actuators at each joint of the walker
	A camera, to allow simpler observation of the walker
	An expanded training algorithm to allow more complex tasks to be achieved
	
### Current Configuration

When executing the .m file, MATLAB will open the multibody 3D visualizer. In current configuration, this will show the walker stood at the edge of the walkway, with the box to one side. The walker can see the cube, and has the goal of moving the box. A gif of this is shown below

## Using the new system
