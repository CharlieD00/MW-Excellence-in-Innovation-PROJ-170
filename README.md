**Pre Trained Walker**

The original system allowed a Humanoid walker to walk along a beam without falling, using an RL agent to avoid falling over
More information can be found here: https://uk.mathworks.com/help/physmod/sm/ug/humanoid_walker.html

The new system expands on this original idea, incorporating a variety of new features:

	Full actuation of the arms of the walker (4 DoF each)
	A customizable cube, which the walker can kick, shove and see to a limited extent
	Realistic, customizable actuators at each joint of the walker
	A camera, to allow simpler observation of the walker
	An expanded training algorithm to allow
