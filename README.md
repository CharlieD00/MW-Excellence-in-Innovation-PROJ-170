# MW-Excellence-in-Innovation-PROJ-170
Group submission for MATHWORKS Excellence in Innovation Project 170, Developing a Humanoid walker in MATLAB. 


**Pre Trained Walker**

The original system allowed a Humanoid walker to walk along a beam without falling

The new system expands on this original idea, incorporating a variety of new features:

	Full actuation of the arms of the walker (4 DoF each)
	A customizable cube, which the walker can kick and shove
	Realistic, customizable actuators at each joint of the walker
	
	
**[How to use the system]**
	
	
[This will be expanded later]
